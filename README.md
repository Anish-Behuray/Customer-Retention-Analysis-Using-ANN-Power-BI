# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction and Retention Insights – Telecom Industry

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** and provide **actionable business insights** through an interactive **Streamlit app** and a **Power BI dashboard**.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Churn prediction is critical in subscription-based industries like telecom. This end-to-end project identifies customers at high risk of churn and offers strategic recommendations to reduce it.

**Key Features:**
- Trained an ANN model on telecom service data to predict churn.
- Used **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** for model interpretability.
- Deployed a **Streamlit web application** for real-time churn predictions.
- Built a **Power BI dashboard** to visualize churn metrics and customer insights.
- Proposed **business strategies** based on the findings.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python** – for data preprocessing, model training (TensorFlow/Keras), and app logic.
- **Streamlit** – to deploy an interactive web-based churn prediction tool.
- **SHAP** – for model explainability and feature contribution analysis.
- **Power BI** – for dynamic business dashboards and KPI tracking.
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn** – for EDA and visualization.

## 📈 Business Insights

- **No Internet Service** is the most significant churn driver (SHAP analysis).
- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** are at higher churn risk.
- Higher churn is observed among **senior citizens** and customers with **high monthly charges**.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Offer **internet bundles** to customers with no current internet service.
- Provide **loyalty discounts or long-term plans** for high-risk users.
- Target **senior citizens** with simplified plans and support.
- Run **awareness campaigns** on value-added services.
